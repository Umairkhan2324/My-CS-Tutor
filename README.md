Welcome to My CS Tutor, your personalized AI-powered tutor designed to support second-semester computer science students. My purpose is to help you master the core concepts of your courses by offering clear, concise explanations, practice problems, and study tips. Here’s what you can expect from me:

## Purpose

I am created to assist you with the following subjects:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++:** I provide detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand the fundamentals of OOP in C++. My guidance is based on the book *"Object-Oriented Programming in C++ 4th Edition"*.
- **Discrete Structures (DS):** I help you develop strong reasoning skills by solving exercises and explaining concepts from the *"Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications"* book.
- **Digital Logic Design (DLD):** I offer support in understanding boolean algebra, truth tables, and circuit design, using the *"Digital Logic Design, 5th Edition"* by M. Morris Mano and Michael Ciletti as my reference.
- **English-2:** I assist in enhancing your English language skills by focusing on sentence structure, types of sentences, and more.
- **Islamic Thought Perspective:** I provide accurate information and explanations based on the provided Islamic studies documents, covering topics like Hadith, Sunnah, and the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
- **Calculus-2:** I solve complex equations step by step, helping you understand the principles of calculus from the *"Calculus-2"* book.
- **Pre-Calculus:** I strengthen your foundational math skills by offering explanations and solutions from the *"Pre-Calculus"* book.

## Special Features

- **Focused Guidance:** I strictly follow the books and materials provided for your courses, ensuring that all my explanations and examples are relevant and aligned with your curriculum.
- **Interactive Learning:** I encourage practice and review by providing exercises and mock tests to reinforce your understanding.
- **Detailed Explanations:** Whether it’s coding in C++, solving discrete math problems, or understanding the intricacies of digital logic design, I break down complex topics into simpler, digestible parts.
- **Real-Time Examples:** I engage you with practical examples that relate to the concepts you’re learning, making it easier to grasp and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations

While I strive to provide comprehensive support, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:
- **Subject-Specific Expertise:** My knowledge is limited to the subjects and materials provided. I cannot assist with topics or questions outside the scope of the books and documents you’ve shared.
- **Static Information:** I rely on the content from the provided materials and do not have access to external or real-time information beyond what is stored in the documents.
- **Non-Coding Subjects:** For subjects like Islamic Thought Perspective, my responses are based solely on the documents you’ve provided, and I cannot offer personal interpretations or opinions.

## How I Can Help You

- **Concept Clarification:** I help you understand challenging topics by explaining them in simple terms.
- **Practice Problems:** I offer exercises and mock tests to help you practice and apply what you’ve learned.
- **Study Tips:** I provide advice on effective study habits and how to manage your time for each subject.
- **Continuous Learning:** I encourage you to keep practicing and reviewing material to build a strong foundation in each subject.

Whether you need help with coding, solving math problems, or understanding key concepts in your courses, I’m here to guide you every step of the way. Let’s work together to achieve academic success!
